    <h1>DRUMMING.</h1>
        <h2>to be Drummer...</h2>
        
    <p>Whether it’s at the very outset of falling in love with the drums – whether it’s during the first few years of drumming – or whether one is well into one’s drumming career: Most of us are constantly trying to figure out how to become a better drummer. For besides the beauty of rhythm, I belive that drumming is in many ways about growth and <span style="color: red;font-weight: bold">self-improvement</span>; </p>
    <p> <q>The separation of talent and skill is one of the greatest misunderstood concepts for people who are trying to excel, who have dreams, who want to do things. Talent you have naturally. Skill is only developed by hours and hours and hours of beating on your craft. – Will Smith</q> </p>
    <code>
        passion = %50;
        practice = %50;
        Total %100 = passion + practice;
    </code>
    <p>Then don’t do it all by yourself. You may think you have a knack for learning things without any help, but from my experience drumming is a different story – and an additional set of eyes can accelerate your learning curve tremendously.</p>

    <li>How sould we start?</li>
    <li>What do we respond to the lessons?</li>
    <li>How we can manage our sound?</li>
</ul>

    <li>Be fluent in fundamentals</li>
    <li>Maintain quality in practice</li>
    <li>Expand your horizon</li>
    <li>Louder or faster is not always better</li>
    <li>Mind your mental state</li>
